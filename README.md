# üèôÔ∏è NYC Restaurant Health Inspections: Unlocking Insights with Data Analysis

## üìñ Project Overview  
This project explores restaurant health inspection data from **New York City**, analysing hygiene and compliance trends using **Python**, **SQL**, and **data visualization** tools. The analysis demonstrates a full **data analytics lifecycle**, from data collection through web scraping to cleaning, exploration, and deriving insights. The project showcases my ability to handle real-world datasets, apply analytical reasoning, and communicate findings effectively.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Methodology  

### 1. Data Collection  
- Collected inspection data from a publicly available NYC web source using **web scraping** with `pandas.read_html()`.  
- Automated data extraction to ensure efficiency and reproducibility.  

### 2. Data Cleaning & Preparation  
- Processed raw inspection data to handle missing values, inconsistent entries, and duplicates.  
- Reformatted column names and data types for analytical clarity.  

### 3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
- Explored trends in inspection scores and violations using **summary statistics** and **visualisations** with Matplotlib and Seaborn.  
- Identified distribution patterns, outliers, and key insights related to restaurant hygiene performance.  

### 4. SQL Integration & Querying  
- Integrated the cleaned dataset into an **SQLite** database.  
- Performed advanced filtering, grouping, and aggregation using SQL queries to extract deeper insights.  

### 5. Insight Generation  
- Merged findings from both Python and SQL explorations.  
- Highlighted key takeaways about inspection outcomes and the impact of violations on restaurant grades.
